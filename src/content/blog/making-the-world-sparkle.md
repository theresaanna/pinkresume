I have always found ways to make my projects delightful for users. This is not the first fun JavaScript package I've released, but definitely the best. I have always been one for cute easter eggs and fun injected into the monotonous. 

Introducing: ✨ Sparklefall ✨

A fun little library for making your website sparkle. 

Please play with the demo and let me know if you implement it anywhere!

It's has vanilla JS, React, Angular and TypeScript support. It's incredibly minimal and without dependencies.
